# Solitaire
When I was taking Advanced Programming this was the semester long project. It had four parts, the first two were to be written in C and the last two in C++.
The first two are executables "check" which makes sure the exchange file is correct and "advance" that checks to see if the moves in the file are valid.
The next two are "winnable" and "game" with "winnable" performing a search for a list of moves that result in a winning configuration and "game" providing 
a playable user interface. I am still working on parts 3 and 4.
